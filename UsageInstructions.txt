          Middle Earth Simulation
**********************************************

-- USAGE INSTRUCTIONS --

Overview
This program simulates a simplified ecosystem of Middle Earth on a 7x20 grid.
Each letter on the map represents approximately 1,000 individuals of a race:

E = Elves
M = Men (Humans)
D = Dwarves
H = Hobbits
O = Orcs

Every simulated year, the program:
- Moves each entity
- Resolves battles when multiple races share a tile
- Performs reproduction
- Removes entities that die of old age
- Prints the updated Middle Earth map
- Prints population counts and yearly events

At the end of the simulation, the program prints a vertical population graph (0–10 scale).

How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Run: python main.py

Program Inputs

1. Initial Population Setup
   You will enter the number of units (each unit = 1000 individuals) for each race.
   Example:
   Men: 8
   Dwarves: 5
   Elves: 3
   Orcs: 6
   Hobbits: 4

   Entities are placed randomly into empty cells on the 7x20 Middle Earth map.

2. Number of Decades to Simulate
   Example:
   Enter maximum number of Decadess to simulate: 30

Simulation Output (Each Year)
- The current year is displayed.
- The 7x20 Middle Earth map is printed.
- Population counts for each race are displayed.
- Yearly events (battles, reproduction, deaths) are listed.

User Control
After each year:
Press Enter to continue to the next year.
Type 'q' and press Enter to stop early.

Stopping Conditions
- User stops the simulation by typing 'q'
- Maximum number of years is reached
- All races go extinct automatically

Final Summary
At the end of the simulation, the program prints:
- Final populations for each race (sorted alphabetically)
- A vertical bar graph (0–10 scale) showing the relative populations
